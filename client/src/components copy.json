It is typically displayed as a horizontal row of links at the top of the page, with each link representing a step in the user's location within the site. For example, on a site that sells shoes, the breadcrumb might display links such as \"Home > Women's Shoes > Athletic Shoes\" to indicate that the user is currently viewing the athletic shoes section of the women's shoes category. Breadcrumbs provide users with an easy way to navigate back to previous pages or sections within a site, and can help improve the usability of a website.",

This is often used to create a smooth, seamless transition between two or more colors, and can be used to add depth and visual interest to a design. \r\n\r\nGradients can be applied to backgrounds, images, text, and other elements in a user interface, and can be created using a variety of techniques, such as blending and shading. In web design, gradients are often created using CSS, which allows designers to specify the colors and direction of the gradient. \r\n\r\nSome common types of gradients include linear gradients, which transition between colors in a straight line, and radial gradients, which transition in a circular or elliptical pattern.",
