For example, on a site that sells shoes, the breadcrumb might display links such as \"Home > Women's Shoes > Athletic Shoes\" to indicate that the user is currently viewing the athletic shoes section of the women's shoes category.

It typically consists of a horizontal bar that is filled in as the operation progresses, with the percentage or amount of the operation completed displayed on top of the bar. \r\n\r\nProgress bars can be used to give users a sense of how far along an operation is, and how much longer they will have to wait for it to complete. They can also be used to indicate the status of a task, such as whether it is in progress, completed, or failed. Progress bars are often used in conjunction with other UI elements, such as buttons and spinners, to provide users with a clear and concise way to monitor the progress of an operation.",

This is often used to create a smooth, seamless transition between two or more colors, and can be used to add depth and visual interest to a design. \r\n\r\nGradients can be applied to backgrounds, images, text, and other elements in a user interface, and can be created using a variety of techniques, such as blending and shading. In web design, gradients are often created using CSS, which allows designers to specify the colors and direction of the gradient. \r\n\r\nSome common types of gradients include linear gradients, which transition between colors in a straight line, and radial gradients, which transition in a circular or elliptical pattern.",

This is often used when there is too much content to display on a single page, and allows users to easily navigate between pages to access the content they are looking for. \r\n\r\nA pagination component typically consists of a series of numbered links or buttons that allow the user to move forward and backward through the pages of content. It may also include other elements, such as a dropdown menu for selecting the number of items to display per page, or a search field for filtering the content. Pagination components are commonly used on websites and applications to improve the user experience and make it easier for users to access large amounts of content.",
